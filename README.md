# COMP210_2_AR VR Task

## VR game proposal
RTS vr game, control and command robot workers to build factories in order to build more robots.
Main objective is to build a giant robot by having your smaller robot minions to construct giant robot parts to then assemble the giant robot to attack the enemy and win the game.


## VR Market and similair games
There's already quite a few RTS game out there, here of some of them that have similair game mechanics to the game I want to make.
RTS vr games:
- AirMech Command
- Brass Tactics
- Skyworld

RTS games that are non VR:
- Planetary annihilation
- Supreme Commander 2


## Key requirments the prototype must fufill:
- RTS type controls using the Vive controllers (area unit selection, point command to move units to position)
- Player can pick up units from the ground and place them somewhere else using the Vive Controllers
- Units can move around and avoid obstacles thanks to AI
- Units can contruct buildings/factories
- Units can carry and move around resources for construction

### stretch Goals:
- Have the units work on building a bigger robot
- a win and lose state to the game
- have ennemy robots that come to attack you
- defense system to defend against enemy robots

## Look of the game
I intend for the game to have a similair look/asthetic to Planetary annihilation and AirMech
